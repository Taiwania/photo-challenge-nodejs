# Photo Challenge Node.js

English | [繁體中文](README.zh-TW.md)

A Node.js + TypeScript application for Wikimedia Commons Photo Challenge operations.
It provides a Web UI and CLI for three common workflows:
- prepare voting pages from submission pages
- process votes and generate revised/result/winners pages
- plan and publish post-results maintenance tasks

## Requirements

- Node.js `24.14.1`
- npm
- A Wikimedia Commons BotPassword login

Setup details:
- copy `.env.example` to `.env`
- set `NAME` to your full BotPassword login such as `MainAccount@BotAppName`
- set `BOT_PASSWORD`
- optional: set `USER_AGENT`, `PORT`, and `CREDENTIAL_SERVICE_NAME`

## Install

```bash
npm install
```

## Quick Start

Web app:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Production build:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

CLI examples:

```bash
npm run cli -- create-voting --challenge "2026 - March - Three-wheelers"
npm run cli -- process-challenge --challenge "2026 - February - Orange"
node dist/cli.js post-results-maintenance --challenge "2026 - February - Orange" --paired-challenge "2026 - February - First aid" --publish-mode dry-run
node dist/cli.js post-results-maintenance --challenge "2026 - February - Orange" --publish-mode live
```

## Usage Overview

### 1. Prepare voting page

Use this before voting starts.
Outputs are written under `output/jobs/<job-id>/generated/`, including `*_voting.txt`, `*_files.json`, and `*_summary.txt`.

### 2. Count votes and publish results

Use this after voting ends.
This workflow validates voters and votes, checks deadlines, and generates `*_revised.txt`, `*_result.txt`, and `*_winners.txt`.

### 3. Post-results maintenance

Use this after winners are known.
It creates winner notifications, challenge announcements, Previous-page updates, and file assessment plans. `sandbox` and `live` now formally publish all four maintenance edit types, and the Web UI still provides grouped review before or after publishing.

## Publish and Safety Notes

- `create-voting` and `process-challenge` support `dry-run`, `sandbox`, and `live`
- `post-results-maintenance` supports `dry-run`, `sandbox`, and `live` for winner notifications, central announcements, Previous-page updates, and file assessment templates
- sandbox targets are derived from the main account part before `@` in `NAME`
- saved credentials use the system keychain when available, with in-memory fallback for the current process
- job history is rebuilt from `output/jobs/*/logs/job.log`

## Validation and Troubleshooting

Useful commands:

```bash
npm run check
npm run check:test
npm test
```

Notes:
- keep `.env` out of version control
- preserve `output/jobs/` if you want to reopen past runs or review publish history
- use `sandbox` before `live` when testing new workflow changes

## Project Status

Implemented and working today:
- Web UI for job creation, progress tracking, artifact preview, publish review, and maintenance review
- CLI for main workflows plus list/archive/voting-index helper commands
- Commons publishing for voting/result/winners pages
- formal maintenance publishing for winner notifications, central announcements, Previous-page updates, and file assessment templates
- regression coverage for parsers, renderers, CLI, job history, and offline workflow fixtures

Recommended next steps:
- add deployment and operations documentation for non-local usage
- expand fixtures for older Commons page variants and unusual signatures
- add end-to-end Web flow coverage for create-voting, process-challenge, and maintenance publish
- consider finer-grained inline word diff inside changed lines
